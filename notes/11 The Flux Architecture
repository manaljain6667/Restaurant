What exactly is The Flux Architecture? 
Again, just like MVC, it is a software engineering pattern.
one of the salient features is unidirectional data flow.

here the central unit for your architecture is the store.
what is the store? 
The store becomes the storehouse for your application state, and any business logic that modifies the application state.
So the store encompasses this whole thing, and the only way you can modify your application state within the store is by requesting the store. 
You don't have any setters that the store make available to you.

You can only request for changes to be done to the state through actions which are synced to the dispatcher. 
So the dispatcher becomes a controlling unit for serializing any actions that you request for changing the store.
