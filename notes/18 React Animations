Transition
• Lets you describe a transition from one component state to another over time

    – When true the component begins the sequence of entering -> entered state
    – Timeout specifies the duration spent in the entering state

CSSTransition

• Uses the in prop to decide when to apply the transition classes

    <CSSTransition key={this.props.location.key} classNames="page" timeout={300}>
    – Should define .page-enter, .page-enter-active, .page-exit, .page-exit- active CSS classes
