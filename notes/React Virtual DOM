Virtual DOM
• Browser DOM is a browser object
• Virtual DOM is a React object
– A lightweight representation of the Browser DOM
– In-memory tree data structure of plain JS objects
– Manipulations extremely fast compared to modifying the browser DOM
– Created completely from scratch on every setState

Updating the DOM
• Diffing algorithm will detect those nodes that are changed
  – Updates the entire sub-tree if diffing detects that two elements are of different types
  – Using “key” you can hint child elements as stable
• No need to re-render where keys do not change
• React Fiber: new reconciliation algorithm in React 16
  – Incremental rendering

the React application's work is that they will do a difference between the previous version of the DOM and 
the current modified version of the DOM. So, to notice which parts of the Virtual DOM tree have changed, 
then you know which of the components need to be re-rendered
