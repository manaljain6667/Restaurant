Virtual DOM
• Browser DOM is a browser object
• Virtual DOM is a React object
– A lightweight representation of the Browser DOM
– In-memory tree data structure of plain JS objects
– Manipulations extremely fast compared to modifying the browser DOM
– Created completely from scratch on every setState

Updating the DOM
• Diffing algorithm will detect those nodes that are changed
– Updates the entire sub-tree if diffing detects that two elements are of different types
– Using “key” you can hint child elements as stable
• No need to re-render where keys do not change
• React Fiber: new reconciliation algorithm in React 16
– Incremental rendering
