What is Webpack?
• webpack is a module bundler for modern JavaScript applications
• It recursively builds a dependency graph that includes every module your application needs,then packages all of those modules into a small
  number of bundles.

Webpack
• Bundle: a JavaScript file that incorporates assets:
    – that belong together
    – should be served to the client in a response to a single file request
    – May include JavaScript, CSS styles, HTML and any other kind of file
• Webpack examines your application source code for import statements
    – Builds a dependency graph
    – Emits one or more bundles
    – Use plugins to preprocess and minify non-JavaScript files: TypeScript, SASS,LESS etc.
• Configuration in webpack.config.js

Webpack Concepts
• Entry: the point where webpack should start and follow the graph of dependencies
• Output: where to bundle your application
• Loaders: Webpack only understand JavaScript. Webpack treats every file as a module. Loaders transform files into modules as they are added to
           the dependency graph
• Plugins: perform actions and custom functionality on compilations or chunks of your bundled modules and more
