Component Types
• Can be classified based how they are used
 – Presentational vs Container
 – Skinny vs Fat
 – Dumb vs Smart
 – Stateless vs Stateful

/**********************************Presentational Components**************************************/
• Mainly concerned with rendering the “view”
 – How things look (markup, styles)
• Render the view based on the data that is passed to them in props(done in dishdetails component)
• Do not maintain their own local state
 – Can be relaxed to maintain only UI state than data

/*********************************Container Components*******************************************/
• Responsible for making things work
  – Data fetching, state updates
• Make use of presentational components for rendering
  – Can wrap presentational components in wrapping divs
• Provide the data to the presentational components in the form of props
• Maintain state and communicate with data sources

So, they are more worried about fetching the data, say for example, from a server and then using the data within the application 
or to set up the state or maybe taking care of updating the state in response to any user interactions on the screen 
or updating the states based upon the data sent back from the server.
