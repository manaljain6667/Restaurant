npm install json-server -g
json-server --watch db.json -p 3001 -d 2000 
  This should start up a server at port number 3001 on your machine
The reason for using this watch flag is that? This json-server will keep a watch on the db.jason file and anytime the db.jason file is modified. 
It'll reload the db.jason file and start serving up that modified data from the server. In addition, we can also give it -d flag, with a value, 
say for example, 2000. Which means that when the server receives a request, it will serve the data back to the requester after a two second delay.
