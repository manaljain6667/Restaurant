React-Redux-Form
• A versatile, fast, and intuitive library for creating complex and performant forms in React and Redux
• Collection of reducer creators and action creators
• Form data stored in Redux store in a model
• Validation support for forms

LocalForm
• Maps form model to local state of the component
• Suitable when you don’t need form data persistence across component mounting/unmounting
• Can still perform form validation using support from react-redux-form

Suppose you want to persist the state of the form even across page reloads or as you navigate in and out of a view, 
then React-Redux-Form would be of use to you. So, this is achieved by the form data being stored in the redux in a model.
