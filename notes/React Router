React Router

  – Router components, route matching components and navigation components
• Uses a browser-based bookmarkable URLs as an instruction to navigate to a client-generated view in your web app

Web App Routing
• Install react-router-dom
• Router component: <BrowserRouter>
– Creates specialized history object
– Also <HashRouter> if you are using a static file server
– Enclose your app in BrowserRouter

Route Matching
• Route matching components: <Route> and <Switch>
– <Route>’s path prop enables specification of the current location’s pathname
– <Route>’s component prop specifies the corresponding view for the location
– Using exact attribute ensures that the path must be exactly matched
– <Redirect> enables the default route specification
– <Switch> enables grouping together several routes
• Will iterate over all its children and find the first one that matches the path

Navigation
• Navigation is supported through the <Link> and <NavLink> components:
  – <Link> creates links in your application
• Will render as <a> in the HTML
  – <NavLink> also attaches the active class to the link when its prop matches the current location
