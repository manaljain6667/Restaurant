What is Single Page Application?
• Web application or web site that fits in a single page
– No need to reload the entire page
– UX like a desktop/native application
– Most resources are retrieved with a single page load
– Redraw parts of the page when needed without requiring a full server roundtrip

Challenges in SPA
• Search engine optimization
• Partitioning the responsibility between client and server
• Maintaining history
• Analytics
• Speeding up the initial page load
