Class Components
• Extend React.Component to get class components
• Need to implement the render() method that returns the view
• Can have local state
• Lifecycle hooks

Functional Components
• Simplest way to define React components
• JavaScript function that returns a React element,or a collection of React elements that define the view
• Receives a “props” object as a parameter
• Cannot have local state or access lifecycle hooks
